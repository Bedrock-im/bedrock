# Bedrock

> Your private workspace by design, not by promise.

Bedrock.im is a work-in-progress project that aims to offer an open-source and decentralized alternative to Workspaces solutions for individuals and companies.\
Its features will include a complete drive to store your files privately, editors to allow you to manipulate your files in a confidential environment, and integrations with decentralized AI assistants, fine-grained permissions systems and anonymous subscriptions for paid services.

Bedrock.im is a project built on top of [Aleph.im](https://aleph.im)'s decentralized cloud, supported by their [Acceleratooor](https://www.twentysix.cloud/acceleratooor/) program.

As the project is still in it's early stages, ways to contribute and understand the technical architecture aren't properly documented yet and will gradually appear in [our documentation](https://docs.bedrock.im).
