| **Issue**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Impact** | **Planned Fix? (Yes/No)**            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Aleph Network outages     | The Aleph network can be unstable, especially when new updates are deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | High       | No (independent from us)             |
| Aleph sharing permissions | Sharing access to files / messages on Aleph can be restricted via several filters, but these don't include specific message hashes. This means that when sharing a file with editing permissions to someone, he will technically have permissions to edit the whole drive of the user. This is mitigated by the fact that the Bedrock UI limits you to the files really  shared, and it can be restricted as soon as Aleph adds this hash filtering capability. | Medium     | No (not planned for Aleph this year) |

## **5. Conclusion**

Bedrock's Beta Test Plan is the first step of ensuring that our project can become a fully usable on-chain workspace
solution, with the latest AI advancements available to enhance productivity, making it a private workspace by design,
not by promise.
